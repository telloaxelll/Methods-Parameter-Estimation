# Methods for Online Parameter Estimation

## Introduction
With the ever growing market interest in autonomous vehicles around the world, many car manufacturing car companies, have sought out to improve autonomous vehicles by improving overall 
safety while operating the vehicle. Other's have sought to explore methods to make these vehicles more algorithmic efficient and test algorithmic robustness. Many challenges up to this day exist with autonomous 
vehicles, mostly from the inherient trait of autonomous vehicles by considered to be "dyanmic" and never linear. 

Mathematicians and car manufacturering researchers have been attempting to best model ACC data using parameter like data that allows companies to better increase the overall effectiveness and safety of these autonomous vehicles.

In this GitHub repository we seek to explore online methods for parameter estimation and explore and test robustness to noise, excitation condition analysis, the introduction of adaptive forgetting factors, and parameter convergence under finite excitation (FE). 

## Methodological Description
1. Online Estimation Parameters:
   - Recursive Least Squares (RLS)
   - Particle Filtering (PF)
   - Neural Networks (NN)
2. Robustness to Noise:
3. Excitation Conditions
   - Explores how persistent vs. finite excitation affeects parameter convergence
4. Adaptive Forgetting Factors.
